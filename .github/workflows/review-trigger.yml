name: Trigger fleet policy review

# PR-time trigger for the central jbaruch/coding-policy fleet reviewer. On every
# same-repo PR event this fires a single-PR review in coding-policy immediately,
# so the policy verdict is available before merge (the coding-policy cron poll is
# only a backstop). Fork PRs are skipped — they cannot read the dispatch secret.
# Dependabot PRs are skipped too — the dependabot actor gets no secrets, so the
# dispatch could never authenticate (the cron poll backstop still reviews them).
#
# Requires one repo secret (set it at
# https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/settings/secrets/actions for this repo):
#   FLEET_DISPATCH_TOKEN — a fine-grained PAT scoped to ONLY jbaruch/coding-policy
#     with `Actions: write` (nothing else). It can trigger the review workflow and
#     nothing more. The Codex credential itself lives only in coding-policy.
