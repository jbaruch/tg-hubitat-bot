# Telegram Bot for Hubitat Elevation

## Quick Start
1. Set up Maker API on `hubitat.local` or use `DEFAULT_HUB_IP` environment variable to specify the IP of your primary hub.
2. Configure mandatory environment variables: `MAKER_API_APP_ID`, `MAKER_API_TOKEN`, `BOT_TOKEN`.
   * If you know the ID of your DM chat with your bot, you can add it as `CHAT_ID` variable.
   * If your primary hub is not using `hubitat.local` DNS entry, use `DEFAULT_HUB_IP` to specify the ip.
3. Deploy the Docker container.
4. Start sending commands to your bot!

## Currently Supported Commands:
* Device Commands:
  * `/on [device name]` - Turns on a specified device.
  * `/off [device name]` - Turns off a specified device.
  * `/open [device name]` - Opens a specified device (e.g., shades).
  * `/close [device name]` - Closes a specified device.
  * `/set_color [device name] [color]` - Sets the color of a compatible device.
  * `/set_color_temperature [device name] [temperature]` - Sets the color temperature of a compatible device.
  * `/set_level [device name] [level]` - Sets the level of a dimmable device.
  * `/double_tap [device name]` - Executes a double tap action on a button device.
  * `/push [device name]` - Executes a push action on a button device.
  * `/hold [device name]` - Executes a hold action on a button device.
  * `/release [device name]` - Executes a release action on a button device.

* System Commands:
  * `/cancel_alerts` - Cancels all alerts in HSM.
  * `/update` - Updates all hubs for which Hub Information Drivers are exposed in the Maker API of `hubitat.local`.
  * `/reboot [Hub Information Driver v3 instance name]` - Reboots a specified hub.

## Device Name Notations:
You can refer to devices in several ways:
* **Full name:** Use the complete device name.
  - Example: `/on Kitchen Lights`
* **Short name:** Omit `Lights` or `Light` if they are the last word in the name.
  - Example: `/off Kitchen`
* **Abbreviation:** Use the first letters of each word in the full name.
  - Example: `/on kl`
  - **Abbreviation conflicts** can be resolved by specifying the first non-conflicting letter in the first non-conflicting word of the name:
    * Let's assume you have three conflicting devices, `Main Bedroom Lights`, `Main Backyard Lights`, and `Main Bathroom Lights`. All three are abbreviated to `mbl`, which creates a conflict.
    * Use `mbel` for `Main Bedroom Lights` as `e` in the second word (Bedroom) is the first unique letter, distinguishing it from `Main Backyard Lights` and `Main Bathroom Lights`.
    * Use `mbacl` for `Main Backyard Lights` as `c` in the second word (Backyard) is the first unique letter, distinguishing it from `Main Bathroom Lights`. Using `mbal` won't be enough, as it is still the same for both `Main Bathroom Lights` and `Main Backyard Lights`.
    * Correspondingly, `Main Bathroom Lights` is uniquely abbreviated to `mbatl`, not `mbal`.

## Prerequisites and Setup:
1. For hub updates: Hubitat version 2.3.9.175 or higher.
2. Install the Maker API app on the `hubitat.local` hub.
3. Ensure Maker API control of HSM is allowed for `/cancel_alerts`.
4. Expose all needed devices in Maker API (including devices from other hubs via mesh).
5. Ensure Hub Information Driver v3 is installed on every hub (via Hubitat Package Manager) and exposed in Maker API on `hubitat.local` (directly and via mesh).
6. Create a bot in Telegram using BotFather bot.
7. Configure environment variables:
   * Mandatory:
     * `MAKER_API_APP_ID` - The Maker API app ID.
     * `MAKER_API_TOKEN` - The Maker API token.
     * `BOT_TOKEN` - The Telegram bot token.
   * Optional:
     * `CHAT_ID` - The ID of your DM chat with the Bot (or other chat the bot is added to).
       If you use that variable, the bot will be able to proactively send information to the chat. If you don't use it, it will only reply to your messages.
       There are number of ways to find this ID, some of them are listed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423837/telegram-bot-how-to-get-a-group-chat-id).
     * `DEFAULT_HUB_IP` â€“ The IP of the hub the Maker API app is installed on. Defaults to DNS hostname of `hubitat.local`.
8. Deploy the Docker image:
- Load the Docker image: `docker load < tg-hubitat-bot-docker-image.tar`
- Create and run the container: `docker run -d --name tg-hubitat-bot -e MAKER_API_APP_ID -e MAKER_API_TOKEN -e BOT_TOKEN tg-hubitat-bot`

## Adding New Device Types:
To add support for new device types:
1. Update the `Device` sealed class in `Device.kt` to include the new device type.
2. Add the appropriate `supportedOps` for the new device type.
3. If necessary, update the `DeviceManager` to handle any special cases for the new device type.

## Building:
* `./gradlew build` - Build the project.
* `./gradlew jibDockerBuild` - Build a Docker container.
* `./gradlew jibBuildTar` - Create a portable tar of the container.
